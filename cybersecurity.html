 <h1> Cyber Security - IT Technologies </h1>
 <p><strong>  Daniel Sodeman - s3977113  </strong></p>

<h2> What does it do? </h2>

<p>Cybersecurity can be defined as “the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks” <i>(IBM, 2022).</i> Cybersecurity can involve various layers of protection, including infrastructure, network, application, and cloud security. It is this holistic strategy that is the best defence against the various cyber threats that people and organisations face daily. </p>

<p> Cybercrime is a problem across the world and is conducted by cybercriminals who use various techniques to attack their intended targets. Cybercriminals, also known as threat actors, can conduct these attacks through discovering and exploiting weaknesses in the security of a computer, network, or system. The cybercrimes that are conducted on a frequent basis include malware, ransomware, and phishing. Through these methods, hackers and scammers target individuals and organisations, usually with a financial motive <i>(CyberTalents, 2022).</i></p>

<p> As per <i> Indusface (2022)</i> the best method of cybersecurity is prevention, as opposed to threat remediation. Threat prevention is a proactive approach, which minimises risks and endpoint damage to stay ahead of the attackers. This involves automated scanning tools, regular penetration testing and threat intelligence. By preventing access to their system, it reduces downtime, disruptions, and loss of data. Threat remediation is the mitigation of attacks through usage of firewalls, anti-virus software and intrusion detection systems. Usually this is done in a reactive and urgent manner, to reduce the damage that may be caused by the intruder. </p>

<p> The state-of-the-art technology in cybersecurity is artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. According to <i>IBM (2022),</i> the average cost of a data breach is $4.35 million USD. However, in the same report showed the use of security AI reduced the cost of a breach to $1.3 million USD. <i>PWC (2022)</i> explain that as cyber attacks become more complex, organisations are turning to AI and machine learning to protect their data. AI improves the speed of detection for cyber threats such as phishing through detection via image recognition and automated tracking. Machine learning detects suspicious changes in behaviour through deep learning to protect against predicted attacks.  </p>

<p> The future of cybersecurity lies in Zero Trust, according to 83% of cybersecurity leaders across Australia and New Zealand <i>(Coates, A., 2022).</i> Zero Trust is a “security framework requiring all users, whether in or outside the organization’s network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated for security configuration and posture before being granted or keeping access to applications and data.” <i>(Crowdstrike, 2022).</i> Traditional cybersecurity follows the trust but verify method. This method puts an organisation at risk of malicious actors taking control of accounts .More than than 80% of all attacks involve credentials use or misuse in the network <i>(Crowdstrike, 2022).</i> </p>

<p> Zero Trust mitigates this by ensuring “greater password security, integrity of accounts, adherence to organisational rules and avoidance of high risk shadow IT services” <i>(Crowdstrike, 2022).</i> With the emergence of cloud computing, the trust but verify method has become obsolete. Zero Trust policies rely on real-time visibility using analytics to ensure an accurate response to suspicious activity that is detected. </p>
<p>As per Crowdstrike (2022), the core principles of Zero Trust are: </p>


    <p> <strong><u>Continuous Verification </u></strong></p>

  <p> Continuous verification ensures that trusted zones, credentials, and devices are never used on the platform. This means that access is given conditionally based on not only risk, but also the IT and compliance requirements of a particular organisation. </p>

    <p> <strong><u> Limit the Blast Radius  </u></strong></p>

  <p> Reducing the impact of a data breach is a critical part of the Zero Trust model. When an attacker has intruded into a system, Zero Trust limits the scope of access paths/credentials, which provides time for the organisation to mitigate the cyber attack. </p>

    <p> <strong><u>  Automate Context Collection And Response  </u></strong></p>

  <p> Data collected by the Zero Trust system must be processed and acted on in real-time. This can involve user credentials, workloads, endpoint, network, and data. </p>

  <h2>What is the likely impact? </h2>

  <p>The implementation of Zero Trust is not simple – it can be a complex and time-consuming process. There are various different strategies required to implement the Zero Trust architecture. As explained by <i> ZPE Systems (2022),</i> there are challenges involved - it is not a turnkey solution, and it requires ongoing management. Zero Trust can also impact staff performance as access needs to be configured on a per user basis. If a user moves positions in a company, all their access must be re-configured, which in a large company would require a large dedication of resources towards the implementation of user access. Secure hardware and flexible software are also required, as information security begins at the lowest level of the chain. The most affected would be the average user in an organisation, as they would need to authenticate regularly throughout the average workday. </p>

  <p> Those who work remotely will need to stop using VPN, with 60% of enterprises phasing out their remote access virtual private networks by 2023 (Raj, 2022). Gartner reports that by this year, it is expected 80% of new digital business applications will be accessed through zero-trust network access (ZTNA) <i>(Raj, 2022)</i> The beneficial impact will be improved security for organisations across the globe. It will prevent cyber attacks, as the most common cause of these is compromised accounts/credentials. It will also result in new jobs created, for management of the Zero Trust projects, as well as ongoing administration of the Zero Trust implementation across an organisation. It will also result in many cybersecurity graduates who can be employed to help deploy the Zero Trust process across a business/organisation, anywhere in the world if they are working remotely. </p>


 <h2> How will this affect you? </h2>

 <p>Cybersecurity is a subject that should be at front of mind for all people who use a digital device on the internet. I use various methods and software to protect my personal cybersecurity, such as a Password Manager such as Dashlane and Antivirus suite such as Bitdefender Total Security. However, the Zero Trust model seems that it would be the most effective way of reducing the harm of a cyber attack. I work in a government department (The Department of the Premier and Cabinet) so this will affect me directly. In our department, cybersecurity is a focus as we possess a lot of sensitive data related to high-level cabinet matters for example. It will mean that I will not be given carte blanche access to all systems through my device – resulting in the need to authenticate regularly which can take extra time out the workday. </p>

 <p>As I work in IT support,  it also means that extra support will need to be given to average users across the organisation in accessing all the systems that they need. This ensure that if there is a cyber attack, then the risk is minimised across the department. For the average person, it means that access will become more restricted If you work in an organisation that enables you access to a computer on their network, and it will affect you. It means that multi-factor authentication needs to be implemented, which will require enrolment for potentially thousands of staff. This may affect friends or family members working in an enterprise environment undergoing these changes. This may include people working in a broad range of areas such education, healthcare, finance and obviously IT.
