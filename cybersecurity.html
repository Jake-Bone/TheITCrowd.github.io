<h2> What does it do? </h2>

<p>Cybersecurity can be defined as “the practice of protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks” <i>(IBM, 2022).</i> Cybersecurity can involve various layers of protection, including infrastructure, network, application, and cloud security. It is this holistic strategy that is the best defence against the various cyber threats that people and organisations face daily. </p>

<p> Cybercrime is a problem across the world and is conducted by cybercriminals who use various techniques to attack their intended targets. Cybercriminals, also known as threat actors, can conduct these attacks through discovering and exploiting weaknesses in the security of a computer, network, or system. The cybercrimes that are conducted on a frequent basis include malware, ransomware, and phishing. Through these methods, hackers and scammers target individuals and organisations, usually with a financial motive <i>(CyberTalents, 2022).</i></p>

<p> As per <i> Indusface (2022)</i> the best method of cybersecurity is prevention, as opposed to threat remediation. Threat prevention is a proactive approach, which minimises risks and endpoint damage to stay ahead of the attackers. This involves automated scanning tools, regular penetration testing and threat intelligence. By preventing access to their system, it reduces downtime, disruptions, and loss of data. Threat remediation is the mitigation of attacks through usage of firewalls, anti-virus software and intrusion detection systems. Usually this is done in a reactive and urgent manner, to reduce the damage that may be caused by the intruder. </p>

<p> The state-of-the-art technology in cybersecurity is artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. According to <i>IBM (2022),</i> the average cost of a data breach is $4.35 million USD. However, in the same report showed the use of security AI reduced the cost of a breach to $1.3 million USD. <i>PWC (2022)</i> explain that as cyber attacks become more complex, organisations are turning to AI and machine learning to protect their data. AI improves the speed of detection for cyber threats such as phishing through detection via image recognition and automated tracking. Machine learning detects suspicious changes in behaviour through deep learning to protect against predicted attacks.  </p>

<p> The future of cybersecurity lies in Zero Trust, according to 83% of cybersecurity leaders across Australia and New Zealand <i>(Coates, A., 2022).</i> Zero Trust is a “security framework requiring all users, whether in or outside the organization’s network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated for security configuration and posture before being granted or keeping access to applications and data.” <i>(Crowdstrike, 2022).</i> Traditional cybersecurity follows the trust but verify method. This method puts an organisation at risk of malicious actors taking control of accounts .More than than 80% of all attacks involve credentials use or misuse in the network <i>(Crowdstrike, 2022).</i> </p>

<p> Zero Trust mitigates this by ensuring “greater password security, integrity of accounts, adherence to organisational rules and avoidance of high risk shadow IT services” <i>(Crowdstrike, 2022).</i> With the emergence of cloud computing, the trust but verify method has become obsolete. Zero Trust policies rely on real-time visibility using analytics to ensure an accurate response to suspicious activity that is detected.
